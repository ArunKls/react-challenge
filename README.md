## Development process

I quickly realized that a recursive approach was needed for this problem. Since there may be stacked children components.
I faced particular issues in debugging the recursive code. Also, I realized that some properties like bold and underline need to be passed to the recursive function.
The implementation of UseState for clause blocks. There are some commented remanents in code.
Overall, this is a very unique assignment and I got to learn a lot regarding nuances in react development and edge cases.
